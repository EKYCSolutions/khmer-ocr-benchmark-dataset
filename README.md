<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

To standardize the OCR accuracy result of the Khmer language, we have created a dataset of Khmer texts. The dataset is a collection of images of Khmer texts, and the texts are the ground truth of the images.

We provide both images and annotations as well as tools to help you with the evaluation of the accuracy of the OCR result.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can find the scripts in the `scripts` directory. Each script has a description of what it does.

You can run the script by typing `./scripts/<script-name>`. For example, to run the `install.sh` script, you would type `./scripts/install.sh`. You can also run the script from the command line by typing `bash scripts/<script-name>`.

The `download.sh` script will download the dataset and unzip it. It will also create a `data` directory in the current directory.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

- `scripts/download.sh` will download the dataset and unzip it. It will also create `images` and `annotations` directory in the current directory.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
